## What is VoxPen?

VoxPen is an Android voice keyboard that transcribes your speech with Whisper, refines it with an LLM, and inserts clean text into any app. It runs on a **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** model — you use your own API keys and pay only for what you use. No subscription, no data collection, fully open-source.

This fork disables the app's purchase and license flow. The original billing source remains in the repository for reference, but no billing UI is exposed and the billing client is not initialized. Voice input, refinement, and file transcription are available without an in-app usage plan.

For Chinese, only the final text displayed/committed by the IME is converted to Simplified Chinese. File transcription, SRT export, file translation, and LLM responses retain their existing output behavior.

## Features

### Voice Dictation
Tap the mic and speak. VoxPen sends audio to Whisper for transcription, optionally refines with an LLM, and shows both versions in the candidate bar. Tap to insert.

### Translation Mode
Speak in one language, output in another. Quick-switch target languages directly from the keyboard — no need to open Settings.

### Speak to Edit
Select text in any app, switch to VoxPen, enable Edit Mode, and speak your instruction (e.g., "make it more formal"). The LLM rewrites the selection in place.

### Auto Tone
VoxPen detects the active app and auto-selects the appropriate writing style — casual for messaging, formal for email, professional for Slack. Customizable per-app rules.

### Voice Commands
10 trilingual commands (zh-TW / en / ja) — send, delete, newline, space, undo, select all, copy, paste, cut, clear all. No API call needed.

### Audio File Transcription
Transcribe audio/video files with progress tracking. Export as TXT or SRT subtitles.

### Custom Vocabulary
The custom vocabulary keeps a 10-entry user limit to keep recognition and refinement prompts focused. The LLM prompt builder separately caps the vocabulary suffix by estimated tokens.

### Privacy-First
- **BYOK**: Audio goes directly from your device to your API provider
- **No telemetry**, no analytics, no user accounts
- API keys encrypted with Android Keystore
- Only 2 permissions: `INTERNET` + `RECORD_AUDIO`

## Keyboard Layout

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔄 說中文 → English            [×] │  ← translation indicator
│  🔵 Original: [raw transcription]    │  ← tap to insert
│  ✨ Refined:  [polished text]        │  ← tap to insert
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│  🌐  │  ⌫  │    🎤    │  ⏎  │  ⚙️  │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Button | Tap | Long-press |

| 🌐 | Previous keyboard | System IME picker |
| ⌫ | Backspace | — |
| 🎤 | Start/stop recording | — |
| ⏎ | Enter | — |
| ⚙️ | Open Settings | Quick settings (language / refinement / translation / edit mode) |

## Supported Languages

| Language | STT | LLM Refinement | Translation |
|----------|-----|----------------|-------------|
| Chinese (Simplified at IME commit) | Whisper | Existing Chinese prompt | Target/source |
| English | Whisper | Dedicated prompt | Target/source |
| 日本語 | Whisper | Dedicated prompt | Target/source |
| Auto-detect | Whisper | Mixed-language prompt | — |

Whisper supports 99 languages for STT. VoxPen currently exposes 3 + auto-detect with dedicated refinement prompts. The existing Chinese prompts and file/LLM outputs are not rewritten by the IME-only Simplified conversion.

## Supported Providers

| Provider | STT | LLM | Notes |
|----------|-----|-----|-------|
| **Groq** | Whisper large-v3-turbo | LLaMA, Qwen, etc. | Free tier available |
| **OpenAI** | Whisper, GPT-4o transcribe | GPT-4o, etc. | |
| **Anthropic** | — | Claude | LLM only |
| **Custom** | Any Whisper-compatible endpoint | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint | Self-hosted support |

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests: `./gradlew test`
5. Run lint: `./gradlew ktlintCheck detekt`
6. Commit with conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.)
7. Open a Pull Request

### Development Notes

- The project follows TDD (Test-Driven Development) — write tests first
- Run `./gradlew test` before submitting PRs
- IME testing requires a physical device or emulator with keyboard enabled
- See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed architecture documentation
