# VoxPen vs Typeless — Feature Comparison & Roadmap

Date: 2026-02-28

> This document contains upstream planning history. For this fork, the current behavior is: billing UI and license validation are disabled; usage is presented as unlimited; only the IME final Chinese output is normalized to Simplified Chinese; file/SRT/translation/LLM outputs are unchanged; and the custom vocabulary limit remains 10 entries for prompt-size control.

## Featured Roadmap

### Phase A — Core Parity (v1.x, high impact / feasible)

#### A1. Translation Mode ✅ Shipped (2026-03-01)
**What**: User speaks in Language A, VoxPen outputs in Language B.
**How**: Toggle + target language selector in Settings and IME quick settings (long-press ⚙️).
Routes to a separate `TranslationPrompt` instead of the refinement prompt.
Supports zh→en, en→zh, zh→ja, and reverse.
**Quick Switch**: Tappable indicator row in candidate bar (`🔄 說中文 → English`) lets users cycle target languages and close translation without leaving the keyboard. Smart filtering excludes the current STT language from targets.
**UX Refinement**: 🌐 long-press now opens Android system IME picker (was STT language popup); STT language selector moved into quick settings popup (long-press ⚙️) alongside refinement/translation/edit mode toggles.

---

#### A2. Auto Context-Aware Tone ✅ Shipped (2026-03-01)
**What**: IME detects which app is active and auto-selects the appropriate tone style — without changing the user's saved preference.
**How**: `onStartInput()` in `VoxPenIME` calls `AppToneDetector.detect(packageName, inputType, customRules)` with a three-level priority cascade: user custom rules → built-in 22-app table → `TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_SHORT_MESSAGE` inputType heuristic → null (falls back to saved preference). Effective tone is captured at recording start and passed as `toneOverride` to `RecordingController`; manual keyboard tone-button tap overrides for the current recording only, then auto-detection re-applies on next field focus.

Built-in table covers 22 apps across 5 tones (💬 Casual / 📧 Email / 💼 Professional / 📝 Note / 📱 Social). Custom per-app rules stored as JSON in DataStore; managed via Settings → Auto Tone → Custom App Rules. Toggle defaults ON; when OFF, saved preference is used.

**Also shipped**: Per-App Custom Tone (was Phase B2) — fully integrated as part of this feature.

---

#### A3. Speak to Edit ✅ Shipped (2026-03-01)
**What**: User selects text in any app, enables Edit Mode via long-press ⚙️ → ✏️, speaks an edit instruction (e.g., "讓它更正式" / "make it more formal"), and the selection is replaced with the LLM-revised text.
**How**: `isEditMode` flag in `VoxPenIME`; `RecordingController.onStopRecording(editMode=true)` emits `EditInstruction` instead of refining; `performEditWithLlm()` reads `getSelectedText(0)`, builds an `EditPrompt`, calls `EditTextUseCase`, then `commitText()`.
**Also shipped**: Voice Commands — 10 commands recognized before refinement (no API call required): send/delete/newline/space + undo/select all/copy/paste/cut/clear all. Trilingual trigger words (zh-TW, en, ja).

---

### Phase B — Reach Expansion (v2.x)

#### B1. More Language Exposure
**What**: Expose all Whisper-supported languages in the language picker.
**Why**: Whisper already supports 99 languages. VoxPen currently shows only 11.
**How**:
- Expand `SttLanguage` enum with all Whisper language codes
- Group in UI: "Popular" (current 11) + "More Languages" (expandable section)
- Add refinement prompt templates for high-value languages: Korean, French, Spanish, German
- Low effort for STT; medium effort for quality refinement prompts

**Files to touch**: `SttLanguage.kt`, `SettingsScreen.kt`, `KeyboardView.kt`

---

#### B2. Per-App Custom Tone Mapping ✅ Shipped (2026-03-01)
Shipped as part of A2 — see above.

---

#### B3. iOS App
**What**: Native iOS voice keyboard using the VoxPen architecture.
**Why**: Typeless is on iOS; significant user demand. Closes major platform gap.
**How**:
- Swift + UIKit `UIInputViewController` for keyboard extension
- Share API interaction patterns (Whisper STT, LLM refinement) via REST — no shared code needed
- Candidate bar with dual-result display, copy button
- Settings app for API key management, provider selection
- Reuse refinement prompts and tone presets

**Effort**: High (new platform, Apple review process)

---

### Phase C — Differentiation (v2.x+)

#### C1. AI Query on Selected Text
**What**: User selects text → tap "Ask AI" in keyboard → speak a question (summarize, translate, explain).
**Why**: Makes VoxPen a full AI assistant keyboard, not just dictation.
**How**:
- New button in keyboard toolbar (AI wand icon)
- Read `getSelectedText(0)` from InputConnection
- Record user's question
- LLM call: `System: "Answer questions about the provided text concisely."`
- Display answer in candidate bar or overlay panel

---

#### C2. Personalization / Writing Style Learning
**What**: VoxPen learns from committed texts to build a personal writing style profile.
**Why**: Makes refinement more personalized over time.
**How**:
- Store last N committed outputs in Room as "style examples"
- Include top examples in LLM system prompt as few-shot examples
- Privacy: local-only, never sent anywhere except user's own LLM API
- Toggle: "Learn from my writing" in Settings (default: OFF for privacy clarity)

---

#### C3. Web Platform
**What**: Browser-based voice input for web apps (Google Docs, Notion, etc.).
**Why**: Typeless offers a web version. Removes need for desktop install for occasional users.
**How**:
- WebRTC `getUserMedia()` for mic access
- Direct REST calls to Whisper + LLM (same BYOK model)
- Browser extension or PWA for text injection
- Lightweight — no install needed

**Effort**: Medium

## Summary

VoxPen's core differentiators vs Typeless are:
1. **BYOK** — Typeless is a $12/month black box; VoxPen puts the user in control of API costs and providers
2. **File transcription + SRT** — Typeless is keyboard-only
3. **Chinese IME workflow** — the fork keeps its existing Chinese prompts and vocabulary behavior, then normalizes only the IME final commit to Simplified Chinese
4. **Translation Mode** — shipped; speak in one language, output in another ✅
5. **Speak to Edit** — shipped; select text → voice-instruct LLM to rewrite it ✅
6. **Voice Commands** — shipped; 10 trilingual commands (send, delete, newline, space, undo, select all, copy, paste, cut, clear all) ✅
8. **Copy-to-Clipboard** — shipped; tap copy icon on refined row to copy without inserting ✅
7. **Auto Context-Aware Tone** — shipped; IME auto-selects tone by foreground app with custom per-app rules ✅
8. **Translation Quick-Switch** — shipped; tappable indicator row in candidate bar cycles target languages; 🌐 long-press opens system IME picker, STT language moved to quick settings ✅

The remaining highest-priority gaps:
1. **More Language Exposure** — expose all 99 Whisper-supported languages in the language picker
2. **iOS App** — Typeless covers iOS; we need parity
3. **Personalization** — Typeless learns writing style over time; we should match this
4. **Web Platform** — browser-based input removes install friction
